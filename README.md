* Express.js 4.15.5
* Node.js    8.9.4
* MongoDB    3.4
* Database from mLab
* Deployed on Heroku

## Getting Started

These instructions are assuming a new Ubuntu 16.04 install in a VM for the purposes of this project and its dependencies. Commands for macOS included in the section titles for that section's equivalent instructions. Other Linux distributions will differ.

```
Note: sudo usage is implied for most commands requiring root.
```

### Git

Git is the version control system used to manage the source code for this project as well pushing to both of the Git repositories on GitHub and Heroku.

#### Installing Git 

[macOS instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

```
sudo apt install git
```

Set your Git username:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Confirm that you set your Git username correctly:

```
$ git config user.name

Willard
```

Set your Git email address used for commits:

```
$ git config --global user.email "youremail@mail.school.edu"
```

Confirm that you set your Git email address correctly:

```
$ git config --global user.email

youremail@email.example.edu
```

### Install Node.js

[macOS instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#macos)

```
sudo apt install curl
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
```

### Install MongoDB 3.4 

[macOS instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/tutorials/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)

```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 0C49F3730359A14518585931BC711F9BA15703C6
```
```
echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu xenial/mongodb-org/3.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.4.list
```
```
sudo apt-get update
```
```
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
```

Start MongoDB during development with:
```
sudo service mongod start
```

Open up the Mongo terminal with:
```
mongo
```

Create the local development database with:
```
use starship-db-dev
```

Shut down MongoDB for now with:
```
sudo service mongod stop
```

### Clone the Starship App repository

```
git clone https://github.com/starship-app/starship-app.git
```

### Install dependencies

Change into the newly cloned starship app and install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Install the React dependencies by changing into the ``client`` folder as well:
```
npm install
```

### Begin local development

This is the procedure everytime to setup your development environment:

Start MongoDB:
```
sudo service mongod start
```

Start the Express server in the main project directory.
```
npm run devstart
```

Got to http://localhost:3001 to see the Express server.

Open another terminal. Start the React client side development proxy to Express by first changing into the React directory in the ``client`` folder. Run the React server with:

```
npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 to see the React app.

## Git Workflow

For the purposes of this project we will directly push code to our repository individually since it is a small project. A guide to proper git workflow in the industry is included at the end of this section.

Create a working branch to develop in:
```
git checkout -b your-named-branch
```

Verify you are in your newly created branch, and not the master branch:
```
$ git branch
  master
* your-named-branch
```

Develop and test thigs out in your working branch. Once you have made some small logical progress, remember to add changes and commit often.

Check unadded changes in your codebase with:
```
git status
```


Add all red unadded changes with ``add .`` or ``add -A``. Refer to the linked git documentation in the git section above for more specific add commands. Or use ``git help``.
```
git add .
```

Can commit and write a commit message with the shorthand:
```
git commit -m "Add two-factor authentication"
```

Switch back to your local master branch:
```
git checkout master
```

Fetch any new changes from the remote repository (GitHub):
```
git fetch
```

Now check for any changes or merge conflicts you think might occur with:
```
git status
git diff
```

Merge the fetched changes:
```
git merge
```

Merge your changes from your working branch into master assuming no conflicts:
```
git merge your-named-branch
```

Check that your local master branch is now ahead:
```
git status
```

Push up to the remote repository:
```
git push
```

Create a working branch to work in for another cycle of development:
```
git checkout -b new-branch-of-features
```
